On set and at home- where, for his own pleasure, he continues to work and rework his previous films- Schrader reflects on the highs and lows of his legendary career, the challenges and rewards of slow cinema, and the influences and experiences that continue to shape his approach to filmmaking. With this insightful portrait of one of his filmmaking heroes, Perry captures an artist who is continually at play, intentionally provocative, and never less than vital.",

Behind him is a 2CV into which is squeezed Five Bald Men. Why are they chasing him? And how can he shake them off? As he travels North through France, he encounters razeteurs, women with stories to tell, bullfights, plenty of delicious food, a damp man, mechanics, nuns, a convention of Chrystallographers and much more, coming face to face with the vivid eccentricities of an old country.",

  "overview": "Defeated on the battlefield by Thor, Loki is brought to Odin for justice. But by using his guile and trickery, Loki escapes to Earth. There he will conquer mankind and raise an even larger army to use in his quest for domination throughout the Nine Realms.  Enraged by devastation of his home, Thor pursues Loki, but in the journey, he is rendered defenseless, awakening on Earth without his mighty hammer, or his memory. Alone and disoriented, Thor is besieged by Loki’s followers, hell-bent on stopping him…at any cost. Enlisting the help of a female human companion, Thor fights his way North, in search of his mythical weapon. Finding his hammer, Thor’s identity and prowess are restored and he must now prepare himself for a final climactic battle with Loki, to prevent the overthrow of the universe.",

  "overview": "TRINIDAD - King Curtis, a vagrant on the streets of Port of Spain, is constantly ignored by passersby. He speaks and if he has to - sometimes shouts the truth about the stories behind the newspaper headlines. As the conductor of our story, King Curtis introduces us to a young man named Charlie...  Charlie, a resident east of the lighthouse, is trying his best to stay on the right path. However, with no job in sight, he is finding it hard to say no to other \"opportunities\". A chance of redemption presents itself when Dinah, a professional streetwalker, crosses his path in need of help.  As the story unfolds, King Curtis reveals the ripple effect created by a person's decision making; leading to moments of triumph and moments of tragedy.  'God Loves The Fighter' is a feature film. Set and filmed in Trinidad, W.I.",

Jan starts to recall how they met and how they had to fight her father's dislike of her dating a soldier.

Together, against everyone and everything, they will face a series of obstacles trying to separate them, meanwhile figuring out what love and pain are. Debuting at Curtas, French filmmaker Elsa Rysto presents a love story mediated by ultraviolence, in a modern variation on the classic story of Bonnie and Clyde – or of the more contemporary Mickey and Mallory from “Natural Born Killers”. “Love Hurts” is a simple yet sensitive narrative about the so-called growing pains.",

For the next fifty years, through personal triumphs and despair, through wars and marriages and children and careers, they poured out the secrets of their hearts to each other. They defied a fate that schemed to keep them apart and lived—through letters—or the one most meaningful thing, their undying love for each other.",

Art saves. Most importantly, art heals. We have spent the last couple years in collaboration w/ Jeff Ray as he documented the struggles of what it means to be artists in America. There has been struggle and immense beauty as we have learned to rid ourselves of ego and have given our full selves to making the most genuine art we can to help impact the people of this beautiful world. May this documentary encourage you to create art in this time of global uncertainty. We love you and are grateful for you.",

The Secret Love Life Of Ophelia seeks to fill in the gaps, revealing the growth of that young love through an exchange of letters between the two characters which are both intimate and direct, tender and passionate.  With the consent of Berkoff himself and in direct response to the current closure of theatres, the play is now being adapted for a unique online premiere which will see the letters reimagined as video messages and a cast of 40 exceptional actors coming together to perform them. Together this diverse cast will reveal just how universal the experiences of the young lovers are.",

  "overview": "At the end of the Cold War, something new arised that should influence an entire generation and express their attitude to life. It started with an idea in the underground subculture of Berlin shortly before the fall of the Wall. With the motto \"Peace, Joy, Pancakes\", Club DJ Dr. Motte and companions launched the first Love Parade. A procession registered as political demonstration with only 150 colorfully dressed people dancing to house and techno. What started out small developed over the years into the largest party on the planet with visitors from all over the world. In 1999, 1.5 million people took part. With the help of interviews with important organizers and contemporary witnesses, the documentary reflects the history of the Love Parade, but also illuminates the dark side of how commerce and money business increasingly destroyed the real spirit, long before the emigration to other cities and the Love Parade disaster of Duisburg in 2010, which caused an era to end in deep grief.",

  "overview": "When Rose, a passionate fashion stylist in her 30's living in New York, inherits her grandmother's vintage dress shop, she returns to her small hometown to take care of the store. As she's contemplating closing the store for good, she runs into her charming high school crush, Cole Murphy, who convinces her to restore the store and help people in need that can't afford new clothes. After hesitantly agreeing, the two friends reminisce about their old feelings, and realize that the store is not the only that deserves a second chance, but so does their love.",

  "overview": "My Lover the Killer is the former title of the album by Lydia Lunch & Marc Hurtado released in 2016. The music, first languorous then abrasive, accompanies the verbal flow of the transgressive poetess who comes back to an intimate and violently tragic episode of her own life: her love and death story with Johnny O’Kane.  With her long-time collaborator, Lydia Lunch, face to face with the camera, transforms this naked scene full of troubled anger into a deep dark confession. Hurtado’s images are saturated, grainy, willingly experimental and clash with those of an archive of furious performances. Just like the one who seeks to avoid taking part in her own prophecy.",

But for lead guitarist Brian Head Welch, a dream come true was giving way to a raging nightmare of self-loathing and addiction. At the end of himself, he made an even harder decision than leaving KoRn. Told with intimate access to the family and band, this genre-bending documentary delivers unprecedented access to one of rock's most unbelievable stories of restoration.",

It’s been a struggle but she’s finally poised for a major career boost thanks to her best friend Alexandra, who is taking her wildly popular YouTube lifestyle series onto the high seas for a Caribbean cruise. Tasked with organizing a multifaceted event for the fans onboard and online, Olivia has plotted the journey down to the last detail and planned for every possible contingency, or so she believes. She’s no sooner onboard than she faces her first curveball: the ship’s longtime cruise director has been reassigned and instead she will be working with his second-in-command, Tony Rieves, who has already begun putting his stamp on the ship’s activities. With no option but to adjust to each unexpected development that comes her way, Olivia realizes that there are some things that simply can’t be planned or anticipated – like falling love.",

It is an insurance that guarantees to policyholders 100% returns of the payment with 30% of interests if they don’t break up for 2 years after signing the contract. After the release of the insurance, it receives lots of attention. However, board members of the company challenge him to find the data to prove that most of the policyholders will be breaking up soon. Jeed, a former matchmaker who was transferred under Tan joins him to collect the data, but she is a woman who believes that love cannot be measured, an extremely opposite value from Tan. As they take off their journey to figure out whether the policyholders will break up or not, their battle with their pride begins.",
